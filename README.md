# Towards Generating a Culturally Rich Society of NPCs for Narratives
## Sasha Azad, Chung-Che Hsiao

### Abstract
Non-player characters (NPCs) often play key role in interactive experiences. Traditional research has these characters designed with a specific game instance or interactions in mind. Additionally, current literature uses procedural content generation to create NPCs with individual personalities, emotions and behaviours that are used to validate the NPC's decisions and interactions over their virtual lives. In this project, we present a procedural generation approach that can generate a population of non-player characters with that initially conform to rules and actions derived from their families, while adapting to the society around them over time.
